For this project, we were supposed to create a random password generator.

We needed to use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

I began by setting arrays with each of these different categories within them.

The next step was then to set prompts that alerted the user to select which characters they wanted to use in their password as well as how long they'd like it to be.

I then created conditional statements for each particular case so that the password would return with only the selected characters as well as prompt them if they weren't staying within the guidelines.

The next step was then to randomly grab characters from the selected arrays and create a password.

Then that password is displayed in the box.
